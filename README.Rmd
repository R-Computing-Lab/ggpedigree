`ggpedigree` provides modern tools for visualizing pedigree structures using both 'ggplot2' and 'plotly'. It is designed to work seamlessly with the `BGmisc` package for simulated or empirical pedigree data, and extends the plotting capabilities of the base-graphics functions in `kinship2`.

The package supports:

- Static, publication-ready pedigree plots using the `ggplot2` framework

- Interactive pedigree visualizations using `plotly`

- Layout customization, complex mating structures, and duplicated individuals

`ggpedigree` is useful in behavior genetics, kinship analysis, and any research involving complex pedigree data.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ggpedigree from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

```r
install.packages("ggpedigree")
```

To install the development version of `ggpedigree` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) use:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("R-Computing-Lab/ggpedigree")
```

## Demonstration

```{r load-data, include=FALSE}
library(ggpedigree) # ggPedigree lives here
library(BGmisc) # helper utilities & example data
library(tidyverse)
# if you don't have the most recent version of BGmisc, you may need to install it first as a stop-gap I've added the data loading here
data("potter") # load example data from BGmisc
# if (!"twinID" %in% names(potter)) {
# Add twinID and zygosity columns for demonstration purposes
potter <- potter %>%
  mutate(
    twinID = case_when(
      name == "Fred Weasley" ~ 13,
      name == "George Weasley" ~ 12,
      TRUE ~ NA_real_
    ),
    zygosity = case_when(
      name == "Fred Weasley" ~ "mz",
      name == "George Weasley" ~ "mz",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    )
  )
# }
```

Here is a basic example of how to use `ggpedigree` to visualize a pedigree structure. The `potter` dataset contains simulated pedigree data for the Weasley family from the Harry Potter series.

```{r basic-usage,out.width = "50%"}
ggPedigree(potter,
  famID = "famID",
  personID = "personID"
)
```



## Citation

If you use ggpedigree in your research or wish to refer to it, please cite the following:

```
citation(package = "ggpedigree")
```

```{r,comment='',results='asis',echo=FALSE} 
print(citation(package = "ggpedigree"), style = "text", bibtex = FALSE)
```

A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is
```{r,comment='',echo=FALSE}
toBibtex(citation(package = "ggpedigree"))
```

### Branching and Versioning System
The development of ggpedigree follows a [GitFlow branching strategy](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/automation/version-control/advanced-git/git-branching-strategies/):

- **Feature Branches**: All major changes and new features should be developed on separate branches created from the dev branch. Name these branches according to the feature or change they are meant to address.
- **Development Branch**: The `dev` branch is the main development branch where all feature branches are merged. This branch contains the latest changes and is used for testing and development purposes.
- **Main Branch** (`main`): The main branch mirrors the stable state of the project as seen on CRAN. Only fully tested and approved changes from the dev branch are merged into main to prepare for a new release.
