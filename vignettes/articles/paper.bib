	abstract = {Many behavior genetics models follow the same general structure. We describe this general structure and analytically derive simple criteria for its identification. In particular, we find that variance components can be uniquely estimated whenever the relatedness matrices that define the components are linearly independent (i.e., not confounded). Thus, we emphasize determining which variance components can be identified given a set of genetic and environmental relationships, rather than the estimation procedures. We validate the identification criteria with several well-known models, and further apply them to several less common models. The first model distinguishes child-rearing environment from extended family environment. The second model adds a gene-by-common-environment interaction term in sets of twins reared apart and together. The third model separates measured-genomic relatedness from the scanner site variation in a hypothetical functional magnetic resonance imaging study. The computationally easy analytic identification criteria allow researchers to quickly address model identification issues and define novel variance components, facilitating the development of new research questions.},

Geneticists have devised these indices to measure the degree of inbreeding of a single individual and the degree of relatedness of a pair of relatives. Since the degree of inbreeding of a single individual can be summarized by the relationship between his or her parents, we will focus on identity coefficients for relative pairs. These coefficients pertain to a generic autosomal locus and depend only on the relevant pedigree connecting two relatives and not on any phenotypes observed in the pedigree. In Chapter 6 we will investigate the applications of identity coefficients. Readers desiring motivation for the combinatorial problems attacked here may want to glance at Chapter 6 first.},

To date, biomedical data management systems that cater for family data have usually done so as part of their standard (non-family-centric) data model. Consequently, data managers with computing expertise are needed to extract family datasets and perform family-centric operations. We present a robust approach to handling large family datasets. Our approach is implemented as a new module which extends the capabilities of The Ark, an open-source web-based biomedical data management tool. Using an algorithm designed by the authors, the pedigree module dynamically infers family relationships for any selected subject (not necessarily the proband). A web interface allows researchers to create, update, delete and navigate parental and twin relationships between subjects, and bulk import/export pedigrees. Consanguineous relationships can be captured, and configurable pedigree visualizations generated. A web services interface provides interoperability.},

The collection, management and visualization of clinical pedigree (family history) data is a core activity in clinical genetics centres. However, clinical pedigree datasets can be difficult to manage, as they are time consuming to capture, and can be difficult to build, manipulate and visualize graphically. Several standalone graphical pedigree editors and drawing applications exist but there are no freely available lightweight graphical pedigree editors that can be easily configured and incorporated into web applications.

Results
We developed ‘pedigreejs’, an interactive graphical pedigree editor written in JavaScript, which uses standard pedigree nomenclature. Pedigreejs provides an easily configurable, extensible and lightweight pedigree editor. It makes use of an open-source Javascript library to define a hierarchical layout and to produce images in scalable vector graphics (SVG) format that can be viewed and edited in web browsers.

The software is freely available under GPL licence (https://ccge-boadicea.github.io/pedigreejs/). Supplementary information are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Expanded with four-color images throughout, additional material explaining the use of genograms with siblings and couples, and a thorough updating to essential concepts, this edition provides a fascinating view into the richness of family dynamics.Informative, comprehensive, and beautifully written and illustrated, this book helps bring to life principles of family system theory and systemic interviewing, as well as walk readers through the basics of constructing a genogram, doing a genogram interview, and interpreting the results. 100 color illustrations},
